## 2025-03-01 - Add ARIA labels to Conversation Sidebar inputs
**Learning:** Dynamic input elements that appear conditionally (like the inline renaming input in `ConversationsSidebar`) and don't have a visible HTML `<label>` need an `aria-label` describing their purpose so screen readers can correctly identify them. For buttons containing purely visual/icon content like `"×"`, we must add an `aria-label` to the button and wrap the visual character in an `aria-hidden="true"` element to prevent confusing redundant announcements by screen readers.
**Action:** When implementing inline editing inputs or icon-only buttons in the UI, always verify that an `aria-label` is present. Ensure visual markers (such as the "×" for closing or deleting) are hidden from screen readers using `aria-hidden="true"`.
