# Local Plugin Development Guide

This guide explains how to develop and test plugins locally without publishing them to npm. This is ideal for rapid iteration and private plugins.

## Writing Local Plugins

You can create a plugin directly in your project directory or in a dedicated `plugins/` folder.

A local plugin must export the standard `Plugin` interface.

```typescript
// plugins/my-local-plugin/index.ts
import { Plugin } from "@elizaos/core";

export const myLocalPlugin: Plugin = {
    name: "my-local-plugin",
    description: "A local plugin for testing",
    actions: [],
    providers: [],
    // ...
};
```

## Loading Local Plugins

There are two primary ways to load local plugins:

### 1. Workspace Discovery

The runtime automatically scans specific directories for plugins:

-   `plugins/` (in the root of your project)
-   `extensions/`
-   `~/.elizaos/plugins/` (user-specific global plugins)

Simply place your plugin source code in one of these directories, and it will be discovered.

### 2. Configuration-Driven Loading

You can explicitly list the path to your local plugin in `milaidy.json`.

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "load": {
      "paths": [
        "./plugins/my-local-plugin",
        "~/dev/elizaos/plugins/another-plugin"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Path Resolution

The system supports standard path resolution:

-   **Relative Paths**: Resoved relative to the configuration file or current working directory (`./plugins/...`).
-   **Tilde Expansion**: `~/` is expanded to the user's home directory.
-   **Environment Variables**: You can use environment variables in paths (e.g., `$HOME/plugins`).

## Hot-Reloading

For a better developer experience, use `bun run dev`. This command watches for file changes in your plugin source code and automatically restarts the agent runtime.

## Environment Configuration

You can customize the configuration directory using the `ELIZAOS_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable.

```bash
export ELIZAOS_CONFIG_DIR=~/my-custom-config
bun run dev
```

This allows you to maintain separate configurations for different development environments or test scenarios.
