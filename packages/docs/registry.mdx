# Registry & Plugin Ecosystem

The ElizaOS plugin ecosystem is a decentralized network of extensions that can be discovered and installed by agents. The registry acts as the central directory for all available plugins.

## Plugin Registry Structure

The registry is maintained in a Git repository (`elizaos/registry`) and is compiled into a JSON index (`registry/index.json` and `registry/generated-registry.json`).

### Registry Index

The registry index contains metadata about each plugin:
-   **id**: Unique identifier (e.g., `@elizaos/plugin-weather`).
-   **name**: Human-readable name.
-   **description**: What the plugin does.
-   **author**: Who maintains it.
-   **homepage**: Link to the plugin's source or documentation.
-   **tags**: Keywords for discovery (e.g., "weather", "finance", "utility").

## Discovery Process

The `plugins/discovery.ts` module in the runtime handles discovering plugins. It checks:
1.  **NPM**: Plugins installed in `node_modules`.
2.  **Workspace**: Local plugins in a monorepo setup.
3.  **Config**: Plugins explicitly listed in `milaidy.json`.
4.  **Bundled**: Core plugins shipped with the runtime.

## The Registry Site

The registry site (`registry/site/`) provides a web interface for browsing and searching plugins. It allows users to:
-   Search by name, tag, or author.
-   View detailed plugin descriptions and installation instructions.
-   See compatibility information (required runtime version).

## Submitting a Plugin

To submit your plugin to the registry:

1.  **Host your code**: Ensure your plugin is open source and hosted on GitHub/GitLab.
2.  **Publish to NPM**: Publish your package to the npm registry with the `@elizaos` scope (or your own scope if it's a community plugin).
3.  **Create a PR**: Submit a Pull Request to the `elizaos-plugins` repository adding your plugin's metadata to the `registry/index.json` file.
4.  **Review**: The core team will review your submission for quality and security.

### Naming Conventions

-   **Official Plugins**: `@elizaos/plugin-*` (e.g., `@elizaos/plugin-weather`).
-   **Community Plugins**: `plugin-*` or `@scope/plugin-*` (e.g., `@my-org/plugin-finance`).
-   **Action Names**: Use `UPPER_CASE_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `CHECK_WEATHER`, `SEND_TWEET`).

## GitHub Organization Structure

The `elizaos-plugins` GitHub organization hosts official and community-maintained plugins.
-   **Core Plugins**: Maintained by the ElizaOS core team.
-   **Community Plugins**: Maintained by the community, hosted in the organization for visibility.
