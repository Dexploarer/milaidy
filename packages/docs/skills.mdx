# Skills Documentation

Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend the capabilities of an agent. They define new tasks the agent can perform, often using Markdown as the primary interface.

## What Skills Are

Skills are designed to be concise and focused on a single capability. Unlike plugins, which provide technical integrations (APIs, clients), skills define *how* an agent should use those capabilities or how to reason about specific domains.

-   **Modular**: Each skill is a separate directory.
-   **Markdown-First**: Logic is often defined in `SKILL.md` using natural language prompts.
-   **Assets**: Skills can include templates, images, and other assets.

## Skill Structure

A typical skill directory looks like this:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Required — Frontmatter + Instructions
├── scripts/              # Optional — Executable code (TS/JS/Py)
├── references/           # Optional — Documentation to load into context
└── assets/               # Optional — Files for output (templates, images)
```

## Skill Frontmatter (`SKILL.md`)

The `SKILL.md` file must start with YAML frontmatter defining the skill's metadata.

```markdown
---
name: check-weather
description: Check the weather for a given location.
disable-model-invocation: false
required-os: [linux, darwin]
required-bins: [curl, jq]
required-env: [OPENWEATHER_API_KEY]
primary-env: OPENWEATHER_API_KEY
command-dispatch: "weather"
user-invocable: true
---

# Check Weather

To check the weather, verify the user has provided a location. If not, ask for one.
Then use the `curl` command to fetch weather data...
```

### Writing New Skills

When writing skills, keep these principles in mind:

-   **Conciseness**: Keep instructions clear and brief.
-   **Focus**: One skill should do one thing well.
-   **Degrees of Freedom**: Give the model enough context to make decisions but constrain it where necessary for reliability.

### Scripts vs References vs Assets

-   **Scripts**: Use for complex logic that cannot be expressed in natural language or requires strict execution (e.g., calculations, file manipulation).
-   **References**: Use for documentation or data that the model needs to reference (e.g., API docs, style guides).
-   **Assets**: Use for output templates (e.g., HTML report template) or static resources.

## Adding Skills to an Agent

Skills can be loaded from several locations:

1.  **Bundled Skills**: Core skills shipped with the runtime (`packages/skills/skills/`).
2.  **Workspace Skills**: Project-local skills in your workspace directory.
3.  **Managed Skills**: User-installed skills in `~/.elizaos/skills`.
4.  **Explicit Paths**: Skills loaded from specific paths defined in your config.

### Skill Loader Behavior

The `loadSkills` function resolves skills based on the provided options:
-   `cwd`: Current working directory.
-   `agentDir`: Agent's configuration directory.
-   `skillPaths`: Explicit list of paths to load.
-   `includeDefaults`: Whether to load bundled skills.
-   `bundledSkillsDir`: Path to bundled skills.
-   `managedSkillsDir`: Path to managed skills.

The loader reads `SKILL.md`, validates the frontmatter, and registers the skill with the agent runtime.
